 YEM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yemen has had a rough and tumoltuous history. It used to be partitioned by the Ottoman Empire and Great Britain. Only recently did they get their independence, and already the face many challenges, like an underdeveloped industry and a weak army. It has also been licking its wounds from the defeat by Saudi Arabia. \n\nYemen has a long way to go to greatness, but has many ways to get there. The only question is which one it will choose."
 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Turkey is the remains of the once mighty Ottoman Empire, now fallen to ashes. As Europeans advanced on every side, general Ataturk fought them off and secured the Turks their freedom. So far Turkey has been doing well, but there is many challenges it has. Ataturk's health has been leaving him, and the country has an unsure future. Which way will Turkey go?"
 IRQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Iraq was born out of the ashes of the Great War. As Iraq was turned into a British mandate, it slowly gained it's autonomy. Recently, it is now a free country. But not all is well. \n\nCorruption is rampant in Iraq, as local leaders squabble and ethnic groups want their freedom. It's army is also increasingly becoming unstable, with many coups happening recently. There is an unsteady future for Iraq, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better."
 PER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Persia, once the greatest of all empires in human history, has now been relegated to a punching bag. Britain controls most of the oil reserves in the country with little room out, and the Soviet Union increasingly looks at Iran as a way to get what they also desire. The future is not so bright right now. \n\nBut there is a hope. A hope that this situation can change. A hope that we will have the power of the glory days of old. And we will not make this a dream, but a reality. Ey Iran!"
 EGY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Muhammad Ali Pasha formed the modern Egyptian state. And although he is long gone, the spirit that he created lives inside of us. Although we are nominally under British rule, their power has been waning. Soon will be the time that we make our own decisions, the ones that will change the course of history forever."
 SAU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The dust settled on the barren deserts of Arabia. Ibn Saud, the creator of the modern Saudi state, did what nobody else has done in two centuries; unite Najd and Hejaz under one crown. Although we are still in the nomadic ways, we are doing better. With our lands in Asir and Najran secured after our war with Yemen, we are at a crossroads. Which path will lead us to the most glory?"
 OMA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Oman used to be one of the greatest empires in history, conquering all the way to Zanzibar. Unfortunately for the last century, our fortunes are quite the opposite. Relegates to tiny land under a British protectorate, our glory days seem long over. But it doesn't have to be that way. \n\nBritish power has been waning, and our independence has been growing. Perhaps now is the time to become the power which we were always destined to be."
